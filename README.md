# Python Trivia Game

## Introduction
Welcome to my Python Trivia Game! This project represents my first step into the world of software engineering. As my inaugural Python project, developed entirely by myself, it holds a special place in my journey as a budding programmer.

## Project Description
This is a simple, text-based trivia game written in Python. The game presents players with a series of 10 questions on various topics, each with four multiple-choice options. Players input their answers, and the game provides immediate feedback, keeping track of the score throughout.

## Features
- 10 diverse trivia questions
- Multiple-choice format (A, B, C, D options)
- Immediate feedback on correct/incorrect answers
- Running score calculation
- Final score display at the end of the game

## How to Run the Game
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the `trivia_game.py` file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `trivia_game.py`.
5. Run the command: `python trivia_game.py`
6. Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game.

## Game Rules
1. Read each question carefully.
2. Choose your answer by typing A, B, C, or D (case-insensitive).
3. Press Enter to submit your answer.
4. You'll receive immediate feedback on whether your answer was correct.
5. Each correct answer is worth 100 points.
6. Try to achieve the highest score possible!

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.9.9

## Future Improvements
As I continue to learn and grow as a developer, I plan to enhance this game with the following features:
- Randomized question order
- Ability to add new questions easily
- A graphical user interface (GUI)
- Difficulty levels
- Timer for each question

## Reflection
This project marks the beginning of my software engineering journey. While it may be simple, it represents a significant milestone in my learning process. I'm excited to build upon this foundation and tackle more complex projects in the future.
